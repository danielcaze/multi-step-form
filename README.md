A MultiStep from with reusable components.

## üöÄ Start

These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the project on your local machine for development purposes.

### üìã Prerequisites

What things do you need to install the software, and how to install it?

```
Node & NPM
```

### ‚¨áÔ∏èInstalling Node.Js

First of all, we will install Node.js. This is where we will run our code in the development environment. NPM will come together.

You can follow the content of the link below for a more detailed walkthrough on how to download. (Portuguese)

## üîß Instalations

A series of step-by-step examples that tell you what you must do to get a running development environment.

To download the project to your machine you must:

- Go to the directory where you want to install the project.
- Open the terminal in the same directory and copy & paste the command:
    - `git clone https://github.com/danielcaze/multi-step-form.git`
    - this will download all the files needed to run the application.
- Then in the same directory, in the terminal copy & paste:
    - `npm i`
    - This will download all the dependencies needed to run the application. (This process may take a while to complete, it will use your local network.)
- And finally, to run the application in your local machine, copy & paste the following command on the same directory, in the terminal:
    - `npm run dev`
